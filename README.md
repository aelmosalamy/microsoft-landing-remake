# Microsoft Landing Remake

This project was made as a collaboration between @aelmosalamy and @moha09-coder with the eccentric goal of learning how to utilize remote collaboration tools such as Git and GitHub while gaining useful experience doing front-end development. An existing design was chosen to be replicated so we can focus on the technical, coding aspect of being able to take an existing design from theory to reality.
